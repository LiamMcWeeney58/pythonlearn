50+2*4 #order of operations is used 
5*2 #One star symbol '*' is used for multiplication (5*2=10)
5**2 #Two stars '**' is used to calculate powers (ex: 5**2 = 25 because 5x5=25)
length = 100 #example of how to assign a variable 
height = 9*3 #note for variables: they use order of operations so the order the variables in equation are assigned could change answer
5.25*10**3 #Floating point math is supported (5.25*10**3= 525.0)
#the underscore symbol '_' is used to define the last number used. For example: 5.25*10**3= 525.0, the 525.0 now is the '_' so if you were to do _/2 you would get 262.5
tax = 17.5/47
price = 58
price * tax
price + _ #use of previous number ex: the '_' will be 21.59574 as that is the previous number
round(_,2) #rounding rounds a decimal to a certain amount of decimal places (of your choice!) How it works: round(x,y)  x= the decimal you want to round  y= how many places you want to round
