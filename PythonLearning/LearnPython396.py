50+2*4 #order of operations is used 
5*2 #One star symbol '*' is used for multiplication (5*2=10)
5**2 #Two stars '**' is used to calculate powers (ex: 5**2 = 25 because 5x5=25)
length = 100 #example of how to assign a variable 
height = 9*3 #note for variables: they use order of operations so the order the variables in equation are assigned could change answer
5.25*10**3 #Floating point math is supported (5.25*10**3= 525.0)
#the underscore symbol '_' is used to define the last number used. For example: 5.25*10**3= 525.0, the 525.0 now is the '_' so if you were to do _/2 you would get 262.5
tax = 17.5/47
price = 58
price * tax
price + _ #use of previous number ex: the '_' will be 21.59574 as that is the previous number
round(_,2) #rounding rounds a decimal to a certain amount of decimal places (of your choice!) How it works: round(x,y)  x= the decimal you want to round  y= how many places you want to round
'hello' #output is 'hello'
'won\'t you be my neighbor' #for words with the "'" symbol you will need to put a "\" before the "'" this will make the output have double quotes '""' 
"won't you be my neighbor" #same output as above however you don't need the '\' symbol as double quotes '""' are used
'"Won\'t you be my neighbor?" said Mr.Rodgers'#A quote inside a quote, this is the breaking point. The output of this line is '"Won\'t you be my neighbor?" said Mr.Rodgers' THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT!
